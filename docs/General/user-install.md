# User Installation Guide
Go to [SimpliPlay's official download page](https://simpliplay.netlify.app/#download-options), and download SimpliPlay. Your platform should be automatically selected based on your
operating system, but if not just click on the spinner and change your platform if the detected result was incorrect.

Next, you'll need to figure out your device's architecture. We assume you as the user already know this, but if not [here's a guide online](https://www.chiefarchitect.com/support/article/KB-01230/determining-if-your-computer-is-32-bit-or-64-bit.html#:~:text=In%20the%20Run%20dialog%20that,that%20uses%2032%2Dbit%20architecture.).

Once you've figured that out, click the appropriate download button and wait for the app to download. If you're on Android, scroll down and download an `.apk` file from the latest release (or whichever release you want to download).

If you're on iOS, you'll need to install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (which is only possible on a Mac) and compile from source. In that case, take a look at the [developer installation guide](https://simpliplay-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Developers/dev-install/).

If you encounter any security warnings, take a look at the [help center](https://simpliplay.netlify.app/help) for more info.
