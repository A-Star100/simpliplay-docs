# Integration
We've also created a Node.js movie server tool known as [MovieServer](https://aboutmovieserver.netlify.app).
MovieServer is programmed in a way that it can be easily integrated with most media players ***including*** SimpliPlay.

You can read the [MovieServer docs](https://aboutmovieserver.netlify.app/docs/intro) to learn more about how to set it up.
Both MovieServer and SimpliPlay support HLS and MPEG-DASH streams and support streaming and playing them with [adaptive bitrate streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_bitrate_streaming), which in short automatically adapts the stream's quality based on the user's network conditions.

Both of these are **simple**, and can integrate with each other very easily.
All you have to do is start serving with MovieServer and play with SimpliPlay.
