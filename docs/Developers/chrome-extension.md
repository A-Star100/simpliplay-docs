# Chrome Extension
SimpliPlay is now available as a Google Chrome extension (read more about it in [this blog post](/docs/blog/chrome-extension)).

It is based on the [Hello Extensions tutorial](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/tutorial.hello-world) by [Chrome for Developers](http://developer.chrome.com/), and uses Manifest v3.

It is usable in a side panel, and a regular tab for extra portability.
This extension is heavily based off of the web and desktop versions of SimpliPlay, with some features removed
when needed (for example, the [add subtitles feature](/docs/blog/add-subtitles-removal)).

:::warning
   This extension is **unpacked**, optionally available as a packed
   version for those who want it, but is **NOT on the Chrome Web Store**,
   requiring you to [enable developer mode for extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) in order to install it.

:::important
   This extension (and the web and desktop apps), along with pretty much every version of
   SimpliPlay are considered **finished**, and won't receive many updates unless
   necessary.
   But this is subject to change, so just take this with a grain of salt.
