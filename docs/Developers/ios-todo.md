# iOS Improvements
SimpliPlay, while being on iOS, has a badly designed UI there, along with broken playlist functionality. It was made in a rush when it was created.

So, we've schedueled some improvements for mid-March to late-April that will:
- Completely improve the app's design
- Improve playlist functionality
- Add more features whenever possible
- Fix many bugs, such as the app resisting from being closed
  And more!

Just you wait!

## What can us devs do about this?
You can help by forking the repo and making a pull request to the [simpliplay-ios repo](https://github.com/A-Star100/simpliplay-ios)!
Thank you so much for considering to help with development!
