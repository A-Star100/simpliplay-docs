SimpliPlay officially has a **Google Chrome extension** now!
It is available to download on the official website, but not on the Chrome Web Store just yet.

<!-- truncate -->
It includes most of the same features the desktop and web versions do, but includes some new ones to improve the usability of it as an extension.

You can get the source code [here](https://github.com/A-Star100/simpliplay-chrome-extension)!
