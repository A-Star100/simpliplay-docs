The **Add Subtitles** feature for SimpliPlay has been removed in the web app and Chrome extension
because of web policies preventing the feature from working. The desktop app works, and remains unaffected here.

<!-- truncate -->
Subtitles did not load when the feature was used and instead threw an error, so it has been removed,
and will not come back upon further notice.

Sorry about that, but we really had no choice here.
