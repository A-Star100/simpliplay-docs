Remember the old docs? The old documentation?
It's changed since then.

<!-- truncate -->
It was migrated to the main website here from [https://simpliplay-docs.readthedocs.io/](https://simpliplay-docs.readthedocs.io/).

It relied on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), hosted on [ReadTheDocs Community Edition](https://readthedocs.org/).

It had ads (due to ReadTheDocs Community Edition using ads so they make profit), and a much more plain UI,
without a blog.

It didn't fit with the rest of SimpliPlay's web presence, with a nicer UI that looked more up to date.
It's been scraped off the internet and is no longer available online.

If you really want to revive it, you can find its original source code [here](https://github.com/A-Star100/simpliplay-docs/tree/old-readthedocs), along with the source code for the new docs [here](https://github.com/A-Star100/simpliplay-docs/).
