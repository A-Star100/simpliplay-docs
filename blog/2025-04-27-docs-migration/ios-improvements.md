The previous version of SimpliPlay iOS had an unorganized UI, and broken features.
So we needed to change it.

The new UI features many improvements. *Waaaaayyy* less buttons,
a cleaner UI, better file-based playback, and major code refactoring.

Schedueled in around February, we finally see the iOS app come to life this April.
You can get the latest version's source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/A-Star100/simpliplay-ios/).

Also, I forgot to keep the screen on in physical devices the **whole** time this beta was out!
It got patched in version 0.3.1.

:::warning
The iOS version is still in beta. Expect it to rapidly change and be unstable at times.
