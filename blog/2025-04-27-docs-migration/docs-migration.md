Remember the old docs? The old documentation?
It's changed since then.

<!-- truncate -->
It was migrated to the main website here from [https://simpliplay-docs.readthedocs.io/](https://simpliplay-docs.readthedocs.io/).

It relied on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material Theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), hosted on [ReadTheDocs Community Edition](https://readthedocs.org/).

It had ads (due to ReadTheDocs Community Edition using ads so they make profit), and a much more plain UI,
without a blog.

It didn't fit with the rest of SimpliPlay's web presence, with a nicer UI that looked more up to date.
It's been scraped off the internet and is no longer available online.

If you really want to see it, you can view it in the archive
[here](https://simpliplay.netlify.app/archive/old-docs).
____________

The new docs are built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) (by [Meta](https://www.meta.com/)), which has a much cleaner UI, along with the ability to add a blog and it defaults to using [React](https://react.dev/), also by Meta, which can do a lot more than
plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript when used correctly and with the right knowledge.

And regarding the reception we got, I think the docs will stay this way, with the new UI and all.
